    <h1> AutoBox object </h1>
    <p> When JS wrap something like an object, we call it AutoBoxing, just like when using methods on strings, JS consider the string as a special object. </p>
    <p> Autoboxing works for: String, Numbers, and Bool </p>
    <h3> Objects are refrences. </h3>
    <p> Refrences has intresting features. As you can see you can change the properties of an object even if we have <strong> const object = ... </strong>. <br> That is because const is refrenced to the adress, and the adress is always constant, but we can chaneg the value.  </p>
    <p> <strong> Comparing Objects: </strong> If we want to compare objects, we should just make a function that chekcs if all the properties are the same. If we do obect1 === object2, we are basically checking if their refrences are the same or not. </p>


    <script> 
      // String methods:
      console.log('hello'.length);
      console.log('hello'.toLocaleUpperCase());

      // Objects are refrences:
      const object1 = {
        message: 'hello'
      };
      // Object1 saves the adress of object1, and it is a refrence to it. 
      // So in here object 2 is not a copy, but it is an adress
      const object2 = object1;
      console.log(object2);

      object1.message = 'Good';
      // As you can see you can change the message, even though we wrote const. 
      // That is because const is refrenced to the adress, and the adress is always constant, but we can chaneg the value. 

      // Shortcuts:
      const object4 = {
        name: 'hello', 
        price: 2
      };
      // These 2 lines are the same. 
      // const name = object4.name;
      const { name, price } = object4;
      // This line takes, name and price and save them in variables called name, and price.
