      /* 
        Objects: It is very similar to struct in 
        the C programming language. 
        
        Features:
          a) displaying the whole product
          b) displaying each property
          c) modifying the property
          d) adding a new property
          e) deleting a property
          f) You can have functions as a property -> which is basically a method

        Why and When to use objects?
          a) HAving fetures and properties regarding an object
          like a person: then has features like name, age, hometown, fav color and more

        Built-in objects:
          a) JSON: Jason 
          - Has less features than you can think but it is universal, that is most objects in other programming language is coded in jason syntax
          - Used when sharing data between computers
